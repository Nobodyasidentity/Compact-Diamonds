**Compact Diamonds** is a simple yet very useful Data Pack that adds a new item called "Compact Block of Diamond", crafted with 9 Blocks of Diamond and easily uncrafted in the inventory crafting menu.  
  
Tho the Compact Block of Diamond can not be placed down it can still easily be carried around in **stacks of 64** in any storage.  
### One Compact Block of Diamond is the equivalent to _81 diamonds_.


## Dev Info:
> Compact Block of Diamond can be translated using the key `block.minecraft.diamond_block.compact`, fallback is "`Compact Block of Diamond`".
